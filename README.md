# **THE SPARKS FOUNDATION**
I am currently interning with The Sparks Foundation and as an intern there, I was assigned with few tasks to do. 
The files uploaded here are all a part of my internship program. 

## **TASK 1**
    Prediction Model Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm: 
I build a prediction model with linear Regression. The dataset provided had two columns in it, Hours and Scores. I had to predict "Score" on the basis of number of hours studied.

## **Task 2**
    Prediction using Unsupervised ML:
I build a prediction model using KMeans Clustering. I predicted the optimum number of clusters in the given **IRIS** dataset and represented it visually.

## **Task 3**
    Exploratory Data Analysis
To perform EDA on the given dataset SampleSuperstore. I have drawn some insights of the dataset with the help of graphs and charts and drawn some observations on the basis of that.
